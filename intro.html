        <p>Are you sure sitting around reading isn't boring you Thelma? *Chuckle* You flatter me too much. Still, it's

          Alright, here goes! As I said, I have to practice. Why haven't you gone home yet? *Chuckle* I don't know what
          you see in an old fart like me. I just do what I think is right. No need to bring that up, it's embarrassing…
          …I
          understand. You're welcome. It's only been a day, Thelma. Isn't that a strange thing to do with your boss? But
          I
          prefer to practice my writing skills in here… *Sigh* Alright, you win. Let's go.
